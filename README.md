# Heart-Failure-Prediction
Huge medical data of patients with cardio vascular diseases is available. Using this data, we can build a model using several important factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, platelet count, diabetes which collectively gives an accurate and precise information about the possibility that a patient will die or not due to heart failure. This can be used by the medical fraternity to increase the medical treatment who has high chances of heart failure using the Machine Learning model. This model will be used in the form a website, where after submitting the medical history of the patient, the model will predict whether or not the patient will suffer from heart failure. Azuew Health Bot is integrated through a social media app which the patient can use to get guidance from.
